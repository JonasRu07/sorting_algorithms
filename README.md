Hello,

I'm Jonas and I am currently a highschool student in Germany.

In this project I'm working with differnt sorting algorithms and their fuctionality.

My focus is on unterstanding how sorting lists work, and how this can be implemnted with differmt focus ( ex. lowest comp, lowest storage etc.).

This a experiment and I just wanna have some fun ; )
